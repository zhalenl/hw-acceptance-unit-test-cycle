Feature: display list of movies filtered by MPAA rating
  As a concerned parent
  So that I can quickly browse movies appropriate for my family
  I want to see movies matching only certain MPAA ratings

  Background: movies have been added to database # features/filter_movie_list.feature:7
    Given the following movies exist:            # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:3
      | title                   | rating | release_date |
      | Aladdin                 | G      | 25-Nov-1992  |
      | The Terminator          | R      | 26-Oct-1984  |
      | When Harry Met Sally    | R      | 21-Jul-1989  |
      | The Help                | PG-13  | 10-Aug-2011  |
      | Chocolat                | PG-13  | 5-Jan-2001   |
      | Amelie                  | R      | 25-Apr-2001  |
      | 2001: A Space Odyssey   | G      | 6-Apr-1968   |
      | The Incredibles         | PG     | 5-Nov-2004   |
      | Raiders of the Lost Ark | PG     | 12-Jun-1981  |
      | Chicken Run             | G      | 21-Jun-2000  |

    And I am on the RottenPotatoes home page     # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    Then 10 seed movies should exist             # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:13

      expected #<Integer:21> => 10
           got #<Integer:333> => 166

      Compared using equal?, which compares object identity,
      but expected and actual are not the same object. Use
      `expect(actual).to eq(expected)` if you don't care about
      object identity in this example.

       (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:14:in `/(.*) seed movies should exist/'

  Scenario: restrict to movies with 'PG' or 'R' ratings # features/filter_movie_list.feature:25

      # enter step(s) to uncheck all other checkboxes
    And I uncheck the following ratings: PG-13, G       # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:37
      # enter step to "submit" the search form on the homepage
    And I press "Refresh"                               # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
      # enter step(s) to ensure that PG and R movies are visible
    Then I should see "The Terminator"                  # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:105

Feature: search for movies by director
  As a movie buff
  So that I can find movies with my favorite director
  I want to include and search on director information in movies I enter

  Background: movies in database      # features/movies_by_director.feature:7

    And I press "Update Movie Info"                       # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:52
    Then the director of "Alien" should be "Ridley Scott" # features/step_definitions/movie_steps.rb:17

  Scenario: find movie with same director                       # features/movies_by_director.feature:22
    Given I am on the details page for "Star Wars"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:44
    When I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"              # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:56

Feature: display list of movies sorted by different criteria
  As an avid moviegoer
